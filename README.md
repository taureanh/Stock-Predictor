# Machine Learning: Stock Prices

## Introduction

The objective of this project was to apply Machine Learning models to help in prediciting future stock prices.\
We used two stocks in particular, New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (EDU) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO).\
Using a Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Multivariate regression model, after training and testing, we were able to predict stock prices

* Run app.py
* Access at local host http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## Please Note: 
In our deployed website  we had to remove the predict tab functionality due to the module tkinter not able to be deployed by Heroku
It runs locally through our app.py.
