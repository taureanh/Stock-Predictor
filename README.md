The objective of this project was to apply Machine Learning models to help in prediciting future stock prices.\
We used two stocks in particular, New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (EDU) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO).\
Using a Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Multivariate regression model, training and testing\
we were able to predict stock prices
