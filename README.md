# Machine Learning: Stock Prices

# Project deployed at https://stock-predictor1.herokuapp.com/

## Introduction

The objective of this project was to apply Machine Learning models to help in prediciting future stock prices.\
We used two stocks in particular, New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc. (EDU) and Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO).\
Using a Long short-term memory (LSTM) and Multivariate regression model, after training and testing, we were able to predict stock prices
